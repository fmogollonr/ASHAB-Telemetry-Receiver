# ASHAB Telemetry Receiver

Receiver code for the ASHAB LoRa-based telemetry and SSDV packets. Designed to run on ESP32+LoRa+OLED boards like the Heltec ones.

## Compiling and uploading

Uses platform.io, so just run platformio run -t upload if using it from command line. If you are using the platform.io IDE, just upload it to the board.
